## How to run it

Since the deployment is handle by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (which can only deals with static website) there isn't deployment CLI in the project.

You can still run the project in a dev mode (basically run a static express backend and build a dev bundle)

```
git clone git@github.com:valentinMachado/valentinMachado.github.io.git
cd valentinMachado.github.io
npm i
npm run dev
```

then browse to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
